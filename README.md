UPDATE 4/2016: Currently this web application will no longer run due to the expiration of services from Microsoft Azure, where the SQL database was being hosted.


# Project 1, Part 3

* Assigned: Oct-19
* Due:  Nov-16
* (worth 50% of overall Project 1 grade)


In this part of the project, you will complete the web application by building the front end
on top of the `Flask` Python webserver.  For those students doing Option 3.b, instructions are below.


* [Project overview](http://github.com/w4111/proj1)
* If your teammate has dropped the class, [see the contingency plan](http://github.com/w4111/proj1part1#contingency)
* For any questions about collaboration, [see the Syllabus](http://github.com/w4111/syllabus#cheating)

# Option 3.a: The Web Application

Your job is to implement your proposed web application.  To help you out,
we have provided a bare-bones Flask web application in [./webserver/](./webserver/).
It provides code that connects to a database url, and a default index page.

Take a look at the comments in `server.py` to see how to use modify the server.
You will need to connect to your database used for part 2.



### A Short Introduction to SQLAlchemy

We use a python package called `SQLAlchemy` to simplify our work for connecting to the database.
For example, `server.py` contains the following code to load useful functions from
the package:

        # import useful functions from the package
        from sqlalchemy import *

`SQLAlchemy` is able to connect to many different types of DBMSes such as 
SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and other databases.  Each such DBMS
is called an "engine".  The `create_engine()` function sets up the configuration
to specify which type of DBMS we want to connect to, and what their parameters are.

        engine = create_engine(DATABASEURI)


Given an engine, we can then connect to it (this is similar to how `psql` connects
to the staff database).

        conn = engine.connect()

At this point, the `conn` connection object can be used to
execute queries to the database.  This is basically what `psql`
is doing under the covers!  

        cursor = conn.execute("select 1")

The `execute` function takes a SQL query string as input, and
returns a `cursor` object.  You can think of this as an iterator 
over the result relation.  This is because if you run `select *` 
on a million row table, the entire result isn't sent to your
program at once (you could run out of memory).  Instead, this
object lets you treat the result as an iterator and call `.next()`
on it, or loop through it.  [See the documentation for a detailsed description](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/connections.html#sqlalchemy.engine.ResultProxy).

        # this fetches the first row if called right after
        # the execute function above.  It also moves the
        # iterator to the next result row.
        record = cursor.fetchone()

        # this will fetch the next record, or None if
        # there are no more results.
        second_record = cursor.fetchone()

        # this loops through the results of the cursor one by one
        for row in cursor:
          print list(row)


The above description is a way to directly write and run SQL
queries as strings, and directly manipulate the result relations.
SQLAlchemy is also an [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
that provides an interface that hides SQL query strings and 
result sets from you.  Instead you access and manipulate
tables in the database as if they were normal Python objects.

**In this project, you will directly write and run SQL queries, 
and will not use any ORM functionality.**




### Technical Requirments

Part of your task is to learn how to read documentation, write and run a 
database-backed web application, so we expect that you will use resources available
on the internet to help debug or learn about the necessary packages and technologies.
Ask staff members after you have already attempted a valiant effort at debugging errors.
The technical requirements are as follows:


* Application directly runs SQL query strings without using the ORM to
  connect to and execute queries on the provided staff database.
  * Part of this project is to give you practice writing, debugging, and
    running SQL queries, so tools that shield you from doing this are not
    permitted.
* Web application is written using the Flask framework
* Javascript, CSS, use of advanced SQL features are permitted.
  * In general, make your applications as fancy as you want.  
    If you are unsure if a library is permitted, ask a staff member or on piazza.
* Your application should prevent forms of SQL injection described in lecture.

Note: if you anticipate doing a huge number of queries (say hundreds of queries per second), 
or will have a huge database (more than 10k rows),
please let the staff know so we can allocate resources appropriately.

### Getting started and working with GitHub

* Fork this repository so you have your own copy of the repository that you can edit.
  You will submit a link to the repository.
* Clone it to your local machine (if you have Python installed and want to run locally) or your VM
* Edit your files
* Use the following commands to add and checkpoint (commit) your changes locally

        git add --help
        git add <new files to store in git>
        git commit -m "a sentence describing your changes" <the files you edited>

* When everything has been committed you can `push` all the committed changes so GitHub.com has a copy

        git push

* If you cloned the repository on another machine (say the VM), then you can download and apply those
  changes from GitHub.com

        git pull

Some notes

* Your life will be easier by setting up [SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
  and cloning the `git://....` versions of repositories.  That way GitHub won't keep asking for your password
  when running `git` commands
* Most errors you will encounter can be solved by [consulting](http://www.duckduckgo.com) a [search](http://www.google.com) [engine](http://www.bing.com)

### Running Locally

It often helps to program and test your application on your laptop or local computer, and
run it on the Azure VM when you are happy with the code.  

To run the webserver, go into the `webserver/` directory and run (make sure you have enabled the `virtualenv` environment)

        python server.py 

It should print something like:

        running on 0.0.0.0:8111
        * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8111/

The `0.0.0.0` listens to any IPv4 address on the machine.  The `8111` after the `:` is the port number.
So if this is running on your laptop, you can open you web browser to any of the following URLs

        http://0.0.0.0:8111
        http://127.0.0.1:8111
        http://localhost:8111

**note**: This is just a *mild suggestion*, we are not saying you should or must develop this way!
This is because if you encounter installation or other issues when developing locally, 
there is so much variety between student computing environments that the staff is ill-equipped to 
debug every case over email/piazza.  Your best bet is google, office hours, or asking your fellow students on piazza.

### Deployment


Once you are happy with your web application, you will deploy it to your Azure virtual machine:

1. [Open a port (e.g., 8111 or another port of your liking) on your VM so the world can access it](http://github.com/w4111/syllabus/blob/master/azure_port.pdf).  Remember the port number

1. Write down the url of your virtual machine.  It should be `<MACHINE NAME>.cloudapp.net`

1. Copy your code to the Azure virtual machine, as per instructions above or on GitHub's help pages.

1. Run the python server with the `0.0.0.0` as the host, and port from above.  Run with `--help` if you need help

        python server.py --help

1. Go to `<MACHINE NAME>.cloudapp.net:<YOUR PORT>` in your browser to check that it worked.  
   You will need this URL when presenting the project to your mentor.


### Submission

Fill out the [google submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/2TZOiBreHv)

  
On campus students will present to their project mentor between `11/11` and `11/18`.
The mentors will email you to schedule a 15 minute meeting by `11/4`.
Contact your mentor immediately if you have not been contacted by the end of `11/4`.

You will show off your project using the mentor's web browser:

1. Give your mentor the app's URL so they can run it in Chrome or Firefox -- make sure you tested in those browsers!
    * your grade will suffer _considerably_ if this step doesn't work

1. Your mentor will interact with your application and test the functionality described in Part 1

1. Your mentor may ask to look at your code, so have it available.  
   If the code is on GitHub, then it makes life _much_ easier.

1. The web interface doesn't need to be fancy, however users **should not need to type anything resembling SQL**.

1. Have a number of example interactions prepared ahead of time to show your mentor.  
   The more you impress your mentor, the better your grade is likely to be.


Grading

* Primarily how well your application matches the Part 1 submission, and how well you incorporated the mentor's feedback
* Your grade will not suffer depend on how _styled_ the user interface is (though it may mildly help)
* Your grade will suffer if it doesn't work, requires the user typing SQL, crashes or
  locks up on bad inputs, is vulnerable to the SQL injection described in lecture, and otherwise does
  not work as you described in part 1.


# Option 3.b: Extending The Design

Follow the expansion plans you described in [Part 1](http://github.com/w4111/proj1part1), namely:

1. Extend the ER diagram: more entity sets, more relationship sets, more constraints.  Same as part 1

1. Extend your SQL schema: translate your new ER diagram to SQL and create them in your database as in part 2.  Same deal.

1. Add tuples to your new tables, write 4 queries that use the tables in interesting ways ala 
   [part 2](http://github.com/w4111/proj1part2).


### Submission and Grading

Submission 

* Fill in the [google submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/Vhu6Hvlj4P)
* Submit your ER diagram and SQL schema print outs at the beginning of lecture.
* Your changes to the database should be accessible.

<!--
Follow the [same submission instructions as Part 2](http://github.com/w4111/proj1part2#submit) (this is a foreign reference!)
with the following differences:

* The folder should be named `<YOUR UNI>-proj1part3` (note it's part3 instead of part2)

* Submit to "Project 1, Part 3" on courseworks
-->


Grading will be same as [the grading criteria in Part 2](http://github.com/w4111/proj1part2#grading), 
but for your extended design instead of the original.
